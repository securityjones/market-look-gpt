# Tone & Style Guide for Jeff's Substack Writing

## Purpose

This guide defines the voice, tone, and editorial posture for articles published on Jeff's Substack. The goal is to present thoughtful analysis in a way that feels human, grounded, and experience-based, without sounding academic, corporate, or performative.

The writing should feel like Jeff thinking out loud with the reader, sharing how he's reasoning through an issue rather than announcing conclusions or trying to persuade.

This guide governs how ideas are expressed, not what conclusions must be reached.

## Core Voice: How Jeff Sounds on Substack

### Conversational, structured, and reflective

Write in a style that feels like a mentoring conversation, not a lecture and not a report. Think:

- a smart, calm walk through the problem
- a reflective pause at the right moments
- clarity without urgency

The structure should be clear, but the tone should feel natural – like explaining something to a curious, capable reader over coffee.

**Avoid:**
- academic phrasing
- technical terms
- industry terms
- analyst-note tone
- corporate polish

**Prefer:**
- clarity
- pacing
- deliberate understatement

### First-person plural ("we") as shared reasoning

Use "we" to frame the analysis as a shared process of thinking, not a declaration from on high.

This signals:
- humility
- experience
- openness to being wrong

**Examples:**
- "When we step back and look at this…"
- "What we're really seeing here is…"
- "This is usually where we slow down."

**Avoid:**
- "The correct interpretation is…"
- "Investors should…"
- "This proves that…"

### Invite the reader in with questions

Use rhetorical questions to slow the reader down and surface uncertainty.

Good questions:
- prompt reflection
- highlight tradeoffs
- expose assumptions

**Examples:**
- "So what actually changed over the last few months?"
- "Is this improvement, or just stabilization?"
- "What would have to happen for this view to be wrong?"

Questions should never feel dramatic or manipulative. They should feel honest.

### Explain concepts through observation, not definition

Assume the reader is intelligent and curious, not technical. Use language understandable by a smart, curious non-investor.

Explain ideas by showing how they behave, not by formally defining them.

**Prefer:**
- "When breadth behaves like this, it usually tells us…"
- "Volatility compressing here tends to mean…"

**Avoid:**
- textbook definitions
- indicator primers
- formal theory explanations

The goal is insight, not instruction.

### Language Accessibility Rule (Jeff's Substack)

Jeff's Substack is written for curious readers, not market insiders.

Every article must be readable and meaningful to someone who:
- does not follow markets daily
- does not know investing terminology
- may be reading their first-ever market commentary

**Therefore:**
- Technical market vocabulary must not appear, even if explained.
- Concepts must always be expressed using plain, concrete descriptions.
- Writing should favor:
  - everyday language
  - physical metaphors ("doing the heavy lifting," "holding things together")
  - observable outcomes ("a few stocks carrying the market")

If a sentence would require the reader to know a market term to understand it, that sentence must be rewritten.

This rule applies globally and overrides analytical convenience.

## Editorial Discipline (Jeff's House Rules)

### Neutral, non-performative tone

**Avoid:**
- hype
- certainty
- self-congratulation
- "this is powerful / important / dramatic" language

Let the reader decide what matters. Your job is to frame the evidence clearly and calmly.

### Action-oriented, but not prescriptive

When discussing "what to do":
- Focus on posture, not tactics
- Emphasize how to think, not what to buy or sell

**Examples:**
- "This argues for patience."
- "This is usually where confirmation matters."
- "It's a moment to watch rather than act."

**Never give:**
- trade recommendations
- price targets
- timing calls

### Forward-looking without forecasting

The writing can and should look forward, but only in terms of:
- conditions
- scenarios
- things that would change the interpretation

Never frame the future as a prediction.

**Good framing:**
- "If X happens, this view would change."
- "What matters next is whether…"

### Trust the reader; avoid repetition

Make a point once, clearly, and move on.

Avoid restating the same idea in multiple ways just to fill space or reinforce authority. Substack readers value economy and honesty.

## Pacing and Structure for Substack

- Paragraphs should be short and readable
- White space matters
- Sections should flow logically, not mechanically
- The opening should orient, not impress
- The ending should leave the reader grounded, not energized or alarmed

## Market Analysis–Specific Guidance

*(Applies when writing about markets, charts, or investing)*

### Lead with the regime, not the indicators

Start with what's happening, in plain language.

Indicators and charts are supporting evidence, not the headline.

**Example:**
"The market has become more stable internally, but leadership remains narrow."

**Only later:**
"We see that in breadth, volatility, and relative strength."

### Actions = posture and discipline

"Actions to consider" should describe:
- patience
- flexibility
- confirmation
- risk awareness

**Not:**
- trades
- allocations
- timing

This keeps the writing useful without turning it into advice.

### Use metaphor sparingly and quietly

Occasional metaphors are fine if they clarify:
- "repair vs expansion"
- "stability vs momentum"
- "narrow vs broad"

**Avoid:**
- war metaphors
- dramatic imagery
- anything that sounds like market punditry

### End with humility, not closure

**Strong endings:**
- restate uncertainty
- clarify what would change the view
- reinforce discipline

**Example:**
"For now, the charts suggest we stay the course but exercise caution."
