# Ticker Guide

## Purpose

This document provides the authoritative reference for ETF categorization and naming. Use this instead of looking up each ETF individually.

When describing portfolio positioning, **group holdings by category first**, then list individual ETFs. This makes it easy to connect to Market Look themes.

---

## Categorization Hierarchy

When describing a portfolio, present holdings in this order to align with Market Look themes:

1. **Total Stocks vs Safety** — What % is in equities vs defensive assets?
2. **Within Stocks: U.S. vs International** — What's the geographic split?
3. **Within International: Developed vs International Emerging-Market** — Where's the international exposure?
4. **Within U.S.: Large vs Small, Broad vs Tech** — Any style tilts?
5. **Safety breakdown** — Bonds, cash, gold, commodities

**Important:** Always say "international emerging-market stocks" — never just "emerging markets." This reinforces that EM is a subset of international, not a separate category.

## Grouping for Market Look Connection

When writing Paragraph 2 (Attribution & Market Look Reflection), calculate and state these totals:

### Step 1: Calculate category totals

**Stocks vs Safety:** (connects to VOO:IEF, VOO:IAU, VOO:BCI themes)
- Stocks = all U.S. + all International equity ETFs (including REITs, growth, value, dividend, momentum)
- Safety = Bonds + Cash + Gold + Commodities

**U.S. vs International (within stocks):** (connects to VOO:VEA, VOO:VWO themes)
- U.S. stocks = all U.S. categories (Large, Small, Tech, Growth, Value, Dividend, Momentum, REITs)
- International stocks = all Intl categories (Developed, Emerging, Small, Value, single-country, Intl REITs)

**Developed vs Emerging (within international):**
- Developed = IEFA, VEA, EFA, VGK, EWJ, EZU, SCZ, EFV, VNQI, etc.
- Emerging = IEMG, VWO, EEM, EWZ, etc.

**Large vs Small (within U.S.):** (connects to VOO:IJR theme)
- Large = U.S. Large Cap, Growth, Value, Dividend, Momentum
- Small = U.S. Small Cap, Small Growth, Small Value

**Broad vs Tech-Heavy (within U.S.):** (connects to VOO:QQQ theme)
- Tech-heavy = QQQ, QQQM, VGT, XLK, IYW
- Broad = everything else

### Style categories (Growth, Value, Dividend, Momentum)

These don't directly connect to current Market Look charts but are useful for describing portfolio positioning. Group them under their size category (large or small) when calculating totals.

### Step 2: Lead with the totals that connect to Market Look themes

**Example (good):**
> "The allocation we held was about 82% stocks and 18% safety. Within stocks, roughly 70% was international and 30% was U.S. — with the international piece split between developed markets (IEFA, VGK, EWJ, SCZ totaling ~43%) and international emerging-market stocks (IEMG at ~33%). Given the Market Look's theme that international has been outpacing the U.S., this heavy international tilt was exactly what you'd want to be holding."

**Example (bad):**
> "The biggest pieces were IEMG (~33.3%) for emerging-markets stocks, IEFA (~13.3%) for developed international stocks..."

The bad example lists ETFs without first establishing the category totals or connecting to Market Look themes.

### Step 3: Then list individual ETFs as supporting detail

After stating the category totals, you can list the specific ETFs with their weights. But the narrative should lead with the strategic grouping, not the ticker-by-ticker breakdown.

## Naming Rules

1. **Always include "international"** for non-U.S. equity ETFs
   - ✅ "international emerging-market stocks"
   - ❌ "emerging-market stocks" (ambiguous — could be mistaken for U.S. exposure)

2. **Use "stocks" not "equities"** (per tone guide)

3. **Use "small-company" not "small-cap"** in plain-language sections
   - Technical sections (Detailed Chart Analysis) can use "small caps"

4. **Hyphenate compound modifiers:**
   - "small-company stocks"
   - "large-company stocks"
   - "emerging-market stocks"
   - "developed-market stocks"

---

## Unknown Tickers

If you encounter an ETF not listed here, look it up to determine:
1. What index it tracks
2. Geographic focus (U.S. vs International, Developed vs Emerging)
3. Asset class (Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, etc.)

Then categorize it into the appropriate group above.
