# Market Look Output Format Guide

## Purpose

This document defines the required structure, section order, and presentation for Jeff's monthly market analysis posts.

The goal is to produce a clear, readable market overview for a general audience, including readers with little or no investing background, while remaining grounded in evidence from charts provided with each analysis.

This guide governs what the reader sees.

Analytical reasoning and decision logic are defined separately in the GPT instructions.

## Required Sections and Order

Every post must contain exactly three sections, in this order:

1. Executive Summary
2. What Should We Do?
3. Detailed Chart Analysis

No additional sections should be added.

Do not include a "What to Watch" section.

Do not use second-level subheaders inside sections.

## Executive Summary (Required, Top of Post)

The Executive Summary must consist of three paragraphs, each with a distinct purpose.

### Paragraph 1 – What Changed Recently

This paragraph functions as a **monthly change log**.

- Describe what has changed over the past month compared with the prior period.
- Focus on new developments, shifts, or threshold crossings.
- This paragraph should read like a monthly update, not a recap of long-term trends.
- Mention a chart only if something meaningful has changed since the prior month.
- If a chart continued doing the same thing, do not include it in this paragraph.
- If no meaningful changes occurred across all charts, say so plainly.

Do not restate information that has not changed. Do not recap long-term trends here.

### Paragraph 2 – Current Market State in Context

- Describe what kind of market environment this currently is, based on the broader context visible on the charts.
- Situate recent changes within the past year and longer-term patterns.
- Emphasize structure and balance rather than direction or prediction.

**Ground context in chart evidence:**
- Name specific observations: "Smaller companies are still behind larger ones" not "conditions remain mixed"
- Reference what charts have shown over the past year, not abstract "mood" or "feeling"
- Say which areas have been leading or lagging (e.g., "gains remain uneven," "a narrower set of areas has been doing the work")
- Do not describe abstract "conditions" — describe what the charts show

This paragraph provides orientation, not outlook.

### Paragraph 3 – Snapshot Across Market Slices

This paragraph walks through each chart area in order, giving a brief observation about each. It connects the dots and points toward the detailed analysis below.

**Required ordering (follow this sequence):**

1. **Volatility (VIX)** — calm or turbulent conditions
2. **Stocks vs safety (VOO:IEF)** — risk appetite
3. **Breadth (NAHL)** — new highs vs new lows balance
4. **Small vs large caps (IJR:VOO)** — size leadership
5. **Concentration (QQQ:RSP)** — narrow vs broad participation
6. **US vs international (VOO:VEA)** — geographic leadership
7. **Developed vs emerging (VEA:VWO)** — international breakdown

**For each chart area:**
- State what the chart is currently showing
- Note what has changed recently (or say it's unchanged)
- Be specific — mention threshold crossings, crossovers, or trend shifts when they occur

If a chart has not changed meaningfully, still mention it briefly (e.g., "Small caps continue to lag, with no meaningful change this month").

End this paragraph by summarizing what the charts collectively suggest about current conditions.

**Synthesis Rule:**
Charts must not be treated as independent signals. Their meaning comes from how they agree, conflict, or create tension with one another. When signals are mixed, explain the mix.

## What Should We Do?

This section translates the specific chart signals from the Executive Summary into portfolio-level posture guidance.

**Key requirement:** Each significant chart signal should have a corresponding posture implication. Do not give generic advice — tie guidance to specific observations.

**Structure:**

Walk through the charts that have actionable signals and state what each suggests for positioning:

- If NAHL is solidly positive → this supports staying invested in equities
- If IJR:VOO shows a golden cross → consider increasing small cap exposure
- If QQQ:RSP is pulling back → watch for tech weakness, consider broadening
- If VOO:VEA favors international → consider maintaining or increasing international exposure
- If a chart is unchanged or neutral → it doesn't argue for adjustment

**Example of good output:**

> "The improvement in the new-highs versus new-lows picture argues against an overly defensive stance. At the same time, the lack of broad follow-through suggests caution about chasing recent strength. It makes sense to remain open to areas that are quietly improving — such as smaller companies showing early signs of catching up and international stocks that have been outperforming — while recognizing that many trends are still uneven."

Notice how this:
- Names specific chart signals (new-highs vs new-lows, smaller companies, international)
- Connects each to a posture (not overly defensive, open to small caps/international, don't chase)
- Avoids generic filler ("maintain discipline", "stay flexible", "think in terms of balance")

**Example of bad output (do not write like this):**

> "This feels like a period for maintaining discipline. Staying flexible and avoiding overcommitment to any single narrative makes sense."

This is generic advice disconnected from chart evidence. It could describe any market environment.

**Language guidelines:**

- Use measured, conditional language such as "consider" or "it may make sense to"
- Refer to specific market segments (small caps, international, etc.) not "the market" as a whole
- Focus on balance, emphasis, and defensiveness rather than timing or action

**Do not:**

- make buy or sell recommendations (e.g., "buy IJR")
- suggest timing (e.g., "now is the time")
- provide price targets
- imply urgency or certainty
- give generic advice disconnected from the chart signals

This section should feel practical and grounded, with each suggestion traceable to chart evidence.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

This section provides the supporting evidence behind the Executive Summary.

**Requirements:**

- Include one subsection per chart provided. The number of charts may vary (typically 5–10).
- Analyze every chart that is provided — no more, no less.
- Technical language is permitted here (but not in earlier sections).

**Required chart ordering (same as Paragraph 3):**

1. **$VIX** — Volatility Index
2. **VOO:IEF** — Stocks vs. Bonds
3. **$NAHL** — New Highs vs. New Lows
4. **IJR:VOO** — Small-Cap vs. Large-Cap
5. **QQQ:RSP** — Concentrated vs. Broad Market
6. **VOO:VEA** — U.S. vs. International Developed
7. **VEA:VWO** — Developed vs. Emerging International

If a chart is provided that's not on this list, place it in a logical position within this ordering.

**Each chart subsection must follow this structure:**

1. **Observation paragraphs** — What the chart shows, recent behavior, historical context
2. **"What this implies:"** — A labeled paragraph interpreting what the observation means
3. **"Signal strength:"** — A rating of Weak, Moderate, or Strong with brief explanation

**Each chart discussion should cover:**
- what the chart represents
- what it has been showing historically
- what has changed recently (or remained unchanged)
- how it fits with the other charts

**Handling Unchanged Charts:**

Charts that have not changed meaningfully since the prior review should be treated as **background context, not foreground signals**. In the Detailed Chart Analysis, still include them but note that conditions are unchanged. In synthesis sections (Executive Summary, What Should We Do?), do not feature unchanged charts prominently.

**Do not end with a summary paragraph.** The Detailed Chart Analysis should end after the last chart subsection. Synthesis belongs in the Executive Summary, not here.

**Signal Strength Rating:**

Each chart subsection should end with a signal strength rating: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

This rating reflects how clearly and consistently the chart supports a conclusion:

- **Strong** — The pattern is clear, persistent, and hard to dismiss. It anchors the broader interpretation.
- **Moderate** — The signal is visible and meaningful, but needs confirmation from other charts or could reverse.
- **Weak** — The signal is tentative, mixed, or inconsistent. Encouraging or concerning, but not decisive.

This section exists to explain why the summary conclusions were reached, not to introduce new conclusions.

## Tone and Style

Tone, voice, and writing style must follow the document titled tone-and-style-guide.md.

**General expectations:**

- Written for non-investors
- Calm, explanatory, and grounded
- Avoids sensationalism and urgency
- Assumes the reader may be encountering market analysis for the first time

## Final Note

If the charts do not clearly support a strong conclusion, the post should say so plainly.

Clarity and honesty are preferred over confidence.
