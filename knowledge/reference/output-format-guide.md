# Market Look Output Format Guide

## Purpose

This document defines the required structure, section order, and presentation for Jeff's monthly market analysis posts.

The goal is to produce a clear, readable market overview for a general audience, including readers with little or no investing background, while remaining grounded in evidence from charts provided with each analysis.

This guide governs what the reader sees.

Analytical reasoning and decision logic are defined separately in the GPT instructions.

## Required Sections and Order

Every post must contain exactly three sections, in this order:

1. Executive Summary
2. What Should We Do?
3. Detailed Chart Analysis

No additional sections should be added.

Do not include a "What to Watch" section.

Do not use second-level subheaders inside sections.

## Executive Summary (Required, Top of Post)

The Executive Summary must consist of three paragraphs, each with a **distinct and non-overlapping purpose**. Do not repeat content across paragraphs.

### Paragraph 1 – What Changed This Month (High-Level)

This paragraph gives the **overall characterization** of what changed this month.

- Describe the general mood or tone shift: calmer? more stressed? stabilizing? deteriorating?
- Summarize the key shifts in plain terms — what moved, what stayed the same
- Think of it as answering: "If I had to summarize this month in one paragraph, what's the headline?"

**Plain-language rules for Paragraph 1:**
- No ticker symbols or chart names (VIX, NAHL, VOO:IEF, etc.)
- No technical framing ("moving averages," "crossovers," "death cross")
- Use "stocks" not "equities"
- OK to mention categories (volatility, smaller companies, tech-heavy stocks) — just describe them in plain terms
- Translate chart concepts into plain outcomes:
  - "Day-to-day turbulence stayed muted" ✓
  - "Smaller companies perked up" ✓
  - "The biggest tech-heavy names lost some of their edge" ✓
  - "Stocks from other wealthy countries continued to outpace the U.S." ✓

**Example:** "Over the past month, things mostly stayed calm, but the 'where' of returns shifted a bit. Day-to-day turbulence stayed muted, stocks still did better than bonds, and the overall health beneath the surface stayed positive. The notable change is within stocks: smaller companies perked up, while the biggest tech-heavy names lost some of their edge."

Do NOT include chart-by-chart detail — those belong in Paragraph 3.

### Paragraph 2 – In the Context of the Past Year

This paragraph explicitly situates this month's changes within the **longer-term trends of the past year**.

- Start with a framing like "In the context of the past year..." or "Stepping back to look at the longer picture..."
- Describe what has NOT changed — which long-term trends remain in place
- Explain whether this month represents a continuation, a reversal, or a pause
- Reference specific patterns from the charts

**This paragraph is about the YEAR, not this month.** If something belongs in "what changed this month," it goes in Paragraph 1 or 3, not here.

**Accuracy is paramount in Paragraph 2:**
- The longer-term context MUST match what the charts actually show
- If VOO:VEA shows international beating U.S. (price below MAs), say that — do not say U.S. has had the upper hand
- If smaller companies have been trailing for the year but just started improving, say BOTH things
- Ground every claim in observable chart evidence

**Plain-language rules for Paragraph 2:**
- No ticker symbols or chart names
- Use "stocks" not "equities"
- Name things plainly: "smaller companies," "U.S. stocks," "stocks from other wealthy countries"

This paragraph provides orientation, not outlook.

### Paragraph 3 – Chart-by-Chart Snapshot

This paragraph walks through **each chart area in order**, giving a brief specific observation about each. It's the detailed "since last month" breakdown.

**Technical language IS allowed in Paragraph 3.** Unlike Paragraphs 1 and 2, this paragraph may use:
- Ticker symbols and chart names (VIX, NAHL, VOO:IEF, etc.)
- Moving average language ("above both averages," "short average nudging over the long one")
- Technical framing ("crossover," "threshold crossing")

This is the one place in the Executive Summary where specific chart details belong.

**Required ordering (follow this sequence):**

1. **Volatility (VIX)** — calm or turbulent conditions
2. **Stocks vs safety (VOO:IEF)** — risk appetite
3. **Breadth (NAHL)** — new highs vs new lows balance
4. **Small vs large caps (IJR:VOO)** — size leadership
5. **Concentration (QQQ:RSP)** — tech-heavy stocks vs broad market
6. **US vs international (VOO:VEA)** — geographic leadership
7. **Developed vs emerging (VEA:VWO)** — international breakdown

**For each chart area:**
- State what the chart is currently showing
- Note what has changed recently (or say it's unchanged)
- Be specific — mention threshold crossings, crossovers, or trend shifts when they occur

If a chart has not changed meaningfully, still mention it briefly (e.g., "Small caps continue to lag, with no meaningful change this month").

End this paragraph by summarizing what the charts collectively suggest about current conditions.

**Synthesis Rule:**
Charts must not be treated as independent signals. Their meaning comes from how they agree, conflict, or create tension with one another. When signals are mixed, explain the mix.

## What Should We Do?

This section translates the specific chart signals from the Executive Summary into portfolio-level posture guidance.

This section should be **one paragraph** that translates chart signals into portfolio posture guidance.

**Plain-language rules for "What Should We Do?" (MANDATORY):**
- **No ticker symbols** (not VOO:IEF, not $NAHL, not IJR:VOO — none)
- **No moving average jargon** (not "short-over-long average setup," not "below both averages")
- Translate chart observations into plain posture statements
- This section must pass the "Jeff's Mother" test — she doesn't know what VOO:IEF means

**How to translate:**
- Instead of "VOO:IEF still tilted toward stocks" → "stocks are still doing better than bonds"
- Instead of "$NAHL above +50" → "the new-highs vs new-lows picture supports staying invested"
- Instead of "IJR:VOO turning up into a short-over-long setup" → "smaller companies have started doing better than large ones"
- Instead of "QQQ:RSP slipping under its short average" → "tech-heavy stocks have cooled off"
- Instead of "VOO:VEA below both averages" → "international stocks continue to outpace U.S. stocks"

**Structure (follow this order within the paragraph):**

1. **Open with overall posture** — One sentence characterizing the environment (e.g., "This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency")
2. **Link key signals to posture** — Name 2-3 specific chart signals and what each suggests
3. **Name specific areas for action** — Where should attention or position shifts be considered?
4. **Close with grounded summary** — One sentence wrap-up (not generic filler)

**Key requirement:** Each significant chart signal should have a corresponding posture implication. Do not give generic advice — tie guidance to specific observations.

**When a ratio shows a regime change (crossover against the prior trend):**
- This argues for considering a shift in balance between those two areas
- Example: If IJR:VOO shows a bullish crossover after a long period of small cap underperformance → consider increasing small cap exposure relative to large caps
- Example: If VOO:VEA shows international now outperforming after US led → consider shifting balance toward international stocks
- Do NOT just say "watch" or "stay open to" — a confirmed crossover is a signal to consider acting

**Signal-to-posture mapping:**

**Overall market posture (risk-on vs risk-off):**
- VIX in calm range (12-20) → supportive environment for equities, no need for defensiveness
- VIX elevated (20-30) → some caution warranted, but not alarm
- VIX high (30+) or spiking → consider defensive positioning
- NAHL above +50 → strong risk-on signal, supports staying fully invested in equities
- NAHL above 0 → risk-on, normal equity exposure appropriate
- NAHL crossing below 0 → caution, consider reducing equity exposure
- NAHL below -50 → significant stress, consider moving toward cash

**Stocks vs Bonds (VOO:IEF) — risk-on vs risk-off:**
- VOO:IEF bullish (above MAs, stocks leading) → supports favoring equities over bonds
- VOO:IEF bearish crossover (stocks weakening vs bonds) → consider shifting some balance from equities toward bonds/safety
- This ratio tells you about overall risk appetite, not which equities to own

**Within equities (segment comparisons):**
- IJR:VOO bullish crossover → consider increasing small cap allocation relative to large caps
- IJR:VOO bearish → large caps still leading, no argument to shift toward small caps
- QQQ:RSP pulling back → tech-heavy stocks losing edge, consider broadening toward the average stock
- QQQ:RSP still rising → tech-heavy stocks still leading, no argument to shift away
- VOO:VEA favoring international (bearish for US) → consider shifting balance toward international
- VOO:VEA favoring US → US still leading, no argument to shift toward international
- VEA:VWO favoring one side → consider emphasizing that area within international allocation
- Chart unchanged or neutral → it doesn't argue for adjustment (don't mention it)

**Example of good output:**

> "This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The improvement in the new-highs versus new-lows picture argues against an overly defensive stance. At the same time, smaller companies have shown a bullish crossover against large caps, which argues for considering an increase in small cap exposure. International stocks continue to outperform U.S. stocks, suggesting it may make sense to shift some balance toward international holdings. This is a period to stay diversified, avoid overconfidence, and let improving areas prove they can sustain progress."

**Example of bad output (do not write like this):**

> "This feels like a period for maintaining discipline. Staying flexible and avoiding overcommitment to any single narrative makes sense. It may make sense to stay open to areas that are improving, while watching whether recent improvement turns into something more durable."

This is generic advice disconnected from chart evidence. It repeats itself, uses filler phrases, and doesn't name specific areas or actions.

**Language guidelines:**

- Use measured, conditional language such as "consider" or "it may make sense to"
- Refer to specific market segments (small caps, international, etc.) not "the market" as a whole
- When a crossover has occurred, suggest considering a position shift — not just "watching"

**Do not:**

- make buy or sell recommendations (e.g., "buy IJR")
- suggest timing (e.g., "now is the time")
- provide price targets
- imply urgency or certainty
- give generic advice disconnected from the chart signals
- repeat the same point across multiple sentences
- write more than one paragraph

This section should feel practical and grounded, with each suggestion traceable to chart evidence.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

This section provides the supporting evidence behind the Executive Summary.

**Requirements:**

- Include one subsection per chart provided. The number of charts may vary (typically 5–10).
- Analyze every chart that is provided — no more, no less.
- Technical language is permitted here (but not in earlier sections).

**Required chart ordering (same as Paragraph 3):**

1. **$VIX** — Volatility Index
2. **VOO:IEF** — Stocks vs. Bonds
3. **$NAHL** — New Highs vs. New Lows
4. **IJR:VOO** — Small-Cap vs. Large-Cap
5. **QQQ:RSP** — Tech-Heavy vs. Broad Market
6. **VOO:VEA** — U.S. vs. International Developed
7. **VEA:VWO** — Developed vs. Emerging International

If a chart is provided that's not on this list, place it in a logical position within this ordering.

**Each chart subsection must follow this structure:**

1. **Observation paragraphs** — Start by stating the observable facts:
   - For ratio charts: State whether price is above/below the MAs, whether shorter MA is above/below longer MA, and any recent crossings. **Do NOT state the ratio value itself (e.g., "9.65") — it is meaningless. Only the relationship to the MAs matters.**
   - Example: "Price is above both the 10-week and 40-week MAs. The shorter MA crossed above the longer MA two weeks ago — a bullish signal."
   - For VIX: current level and which range it falls in (12-20, 20-30, etc.)
   - For NAHL: the 13-day EMA value and whether it's above/below key thresholds (0, +50, -50). **Focus on the smoothed EMA only — daily readings are background noise.**
2. **"What this implies:"** — A labeled paragraph interpreting what the observation means
3. **"Signal strength:"** — A rating of Weak, Moderate, or Strong with brief explanation

**Grounding rule:** Your interpretation must match your stated observations. If you state that price is above both MAs with a bullish crossover, your interpretation cannot say the trend is bearish or "unchanged."

**Each chart discussion should cover:**
- what the chart represents
- what it has been showing historically
- what has changed recently (or remained unchanged)
- how it fits with the other charts

**Handling Unchanged Charts:**

Charts that have not changed meaningfully since the prior review should be treated as **background context, not foreground signals**. In the Detailed Chart Analysis, still include them but note that conditions are unchanged. In synthesis sections (Executive Summary, What Should We Do?), do not feature unchanged charts prominently.

**Do not end with a summary paragraph.** The Detailed Chart Analysis should end after the last chart subsection. Synthesis belongs in the Executive Summary, not here.

**Signal Strength Rating:**

Each chart subsection should end with a signal strength rating: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

This rating reflects how clearly and consistently the chart supports a conclusion:

- **Strong** — The pattern is clear, persistent, and hard to dismiss. It anchors the broader interpretation.
- **Moderate** — The signal is visible and meaningful, but needs confirmation from other charts or could reverse.
- **Weak** — The signal is tentative, mixed, or inconsistent. Encouraging or concerning, but not decisive.

This section exists to explain why the summary conclusions were reached, not to introduce new conclusions.

## Tone and Style

Tone, voice, and writing style must follow the document titled tone-and-style-guide.md.

**General expectations:**

- Written for non-investors
- Calm, explanatory, and grounded
- Avoids sensationalism and urgency
- Assumes the reader may be encountering market analysis for the first time

## Final Note

If the charts do not clearly support a strong conclusion, the post should say so plainly.

Clarity and honesty are preferred over confidence.
