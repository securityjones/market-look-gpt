# Market Look Output Format Guide

## Purpose

This document defines the required structure, section order, and presentation for Jeff's monthly market analysis posts.

The goal is to produce a clear, readable market overview for a general audience, including readers with little or no investing background, while remaining grounded in evidence from charts provided with each analysis.

This guide governs what the reader sees.

Analytical reasoning and decision logic are defined separately in the GPT instructions.

## Required Sections and Order

Every post must contain exactly three sections, in this order:

1. Executive Summary
2. What Should We Do?
3. Detailed Chart Analysis

No additional sections should be added.

Do not include a "What to Watch" section.

Do not use second-level subheaders inside sections.

## Executive Summary (Required, Top of Post)

The Executive Summary must consist of three paragraphs, each with a **distinct and non-overlapping purpose**. Do not repeat content across paragraphs.

### Paragraph 1 – What Changed This Month (High-Level)

This paragraph gives the **overall characterization** of what changed this month.

- Describe the general mood or tone shift: calmer? more stressed? stabilizing? deteriorating?
- Summarize the key shifts in plain terms — what moved, what stayed the same
- Think of it as answering: "If I had to summarize this month in one paragraph, what's the headline?"

**Plain-language rules for Paragraph 1:**
- No ticker symbols or chart names (VIX, NAHL, VOO:IEF, etc.)
- No technical framing ("moving averages," "crossovers," "death cross")
- Use "stocks" not "equities"
- OK to mention categories (volatility, smaller companies, tech-heavy stocks) — just describe them in plain terms
- Translate chart concepts into plain outcomes:
  - "Day-to-day turbulence stayed muted" ✓
  - "Smaller companies perked up" ✓
  - "The biggest tech-heavy names lost some of their edge" ✓
  - "Stocks from other wealthy countries continued to outpace the U.S." ✓

**Example:** "Over the past month, things mostly stayed calm, but the 'where' of returns shifted a bit. Day-to-day turbulence stayed muted, stocks still did better than bonds, and the overall health beneath the surface stayed positive. The notable change is within stocks: smaller companies perked up, while the biggest tech-heavy names lost some of their edge."

Do NOT include chart-by-chart detail — those belong in Paragraph 3.

### Paragraph 2 – In the Context of the Past Year

This paragraph explicitly situates this month's changes within the **longer-term trends of the past year**.

- Start with a framing like "In the context of the past year..." or "Stepping back to look at the longer picture..."
- Describe what has NOT changed — which long-term trends remain in place
- Explain whether this month represents a continuation, a reversal, or a pause
- Reference specific patterns from the charts

**This paragraph is about the YEAR, not this month.** If something belongs in "what changed this month," it goes in Paragraph 1 or 3, not here.

**Accuracy is paramount in Paragraph 2:**
- The longer-term context MUST match what the charts actually show
- If VOO:VEA shows international beating U.S. (price below MAs), say that — do not say U.S. has had the upper hand
- If smaller companies have been trailing for the year but just started improving, say BOTH things
- Ground every claim in observable chart evidence

**Plain-language rules for Paragraph 2:**
- No ticker symbols or chart names
- Use "stocks" not "equities"
- Name things plainly: "smaller companies," "U.S. stocks," "stocks from other wealthy countries"

This paragraph provides orientation, not outlook.

### Paragraph 3 – Chart-by-Chart Snapshot

This paragraph walks through **each chart area in order**, telling the story of what changed and what it means. It's the detailed "since last month" breakdown — written in **plain, interpretive language**.

**Lead with meaning, not mechanics.** Paragraph 3 should read like accessible market commentary, not a technical data dump. You don't need to name ticker symbols or describe moving average positions — just tell the reader what each area is signaling.

**The goal:** A reader should understand what each chart means for them without needing to know what "above both averages" or "golden cross" means.

**Example of the correct style:**

> "Volatility stayed quiet. The breadth signal continues to support staying invested in stocks. Stocks are doing better than bonds, but gold and commodities are both showing relative strength against stocks — a mixed picture on the 'stocks vs safety' question. Within stocks, small caps have started to catch up after a long stretch of lagging behind large caps. Tech-heavy stocks are no longer pulling ahead of the broader market. And international remains the story: both developed and emerging markets continue to outperform U.S. stocks."

Notice: No ticker symbols. No "above both averages." Just clear statements about what each area is telling us.

**DO NOT write like this:**

> "$VIX stayed in the mid-teens and below its key averages, keeping the 'quiet tape' intact. $NAHL's 13-day EMA remains above +50, which is the kind of breadth reading that typically supports staying invested. VOO:IEF remains above both averages (stocks still ahead of bonds). VOO:IJR has dropped below both averages with the shorter average now below the longer one — an early 'small caps catching up' tell."

This leads with technical observations and buries the interpretation in parentheticals. Flip it: lead with interpretation, skip the technical scaffolding.

**Required ordering (follow this sequence):**

**Tier 1 — Macro Conditions:**
1. **Volatility** — calm or turbulent conditions
2. **Breadth** — what the new highs vs new lows signal says

**Tier 2 — Big Allocation Questions:**
3. **Stocks vs safety** — stocks vs bonds, gold, and commodities
4. **US vs international** — developed and emerging markets vs US

**Tier 3 — Drilling Down:**
5. **Large vs small caps** — size leadership within US (VOO:IJR)
6. **Broad market vs tech** — broad market vs tech-heavy stocks within US (VOO:QQQ)

**Notes on US vs International group:**
The two charts (VOO:VEA, VOO:VWO) together answer "US or international?" If both favor international, that's a clear tilt. If mixed (e.g., US trails developed but leads emerging), explain the nuance.

**Notes on Stocks vs Safety group:**
The three "stocks vs safety" charts (VOO:IEF, VOO:IAU, VOO:BCI) can be discussed as a synthesized group when they tell a coherent story (e.g., "Stocks remain preferred over all three safety alternatives") or individually when they diverge (e.g., "Stocks still lead bonds, but gold is starting to compete").

**For each chart area:**
- State what the chart is currently showing
- Note what has changed recently (or say it's unchanged)
- **Interpret what it means** — don't just observe, explain the implication
- Be specific — mention threshold crossings, crossovers, or trend shifts when they occur

**Observation vs Interpretation — CRITICAL:**

Paragraph 3 must go beyond mechanical observation. Each chart mention should tell the reader what changed AND what it means.

| ❌ Observation only (don't write this) | ✅ Interpretation (write this) |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "$VIX remains in the calm zone and is sitting below its longer moving averages" | "Volatility has continued to settle, reinforcing the calmer price behavior that began late last year" |
| "VOO:IEF stays above both key averages (stocks still ahead of bonds)" | "Stocks relative to safer assets have held their ground rather than weakening further" |
| "VOO:IJR dropped below both averages with the shorter average now below the longer" | "Smaller U.S. companies have stopped falling further behind large ones and have shown early signs of catching up" |
| "$NAHL (13-day EMA) is still above +50, though it's off its prior peak" | "The balance between stocks reaching new highs and new lows has moved decisively out of a caution zone and into a range that, in past periods, has aligned with healthier conditions" |

**Key difference:** The observation column reads like a checklist of what the chart shows. The interpretation column tells a *story* — what changed, what it means, and how it connects to the broader picture.

If a chart has not changed meaningfully, still mention it briefly (e.g., "Small caps continue to lag, with no meaningful change this month").

End this paragraph by summarizing what the charts collectively suggest about current conditions — not just a list of signals, but a synthesis of what the picture looks like taken together (e.g., "Taken together, the charts describe a market that has moved out of a stressed state and into a quieter, more balanced one — but not yet into a broadly strong or fully reinforced phase").

**Optional: "Lesson of the month" closer**

When the data suggests a clear investing lesson, you may end Paragraph 3 with a sentence that reflects on what principle this month's picture illustrates. This is backward-looking ("this month showed..."), not forward-looking action guidance (that belongs in "What Should We Do?").

Only include this when the lesson feels earned from the data — don't force generic advice.

**Example framings:**
- "This is a market that rewarded diversification over concentration."
- "Months like this remind us why geographic diversification matters."
- "This month showed the value of spreading bets beyond U.S. large-cap tech."
- "The data reinforces that 'just own the biggest names' has gotten more complicated."

**Synthesis Rule:**
Charts must not be treated as independent signals. Their meaning comes from how they agree, conflict, or create tension with one another. When signals are mixed, explain the mix.

## What Should We Do?

This section translates the specific chart signals from the Executive Summary into portfolio-level posture guidance.

This section should be **one paragraph** that translates chart signals into portfolio posture guidance.

**Plain-language rules for "What Should We Do?" (MANDATORY):**
- **No ticker symbols** (not VOO:IEF, not $NAHL, not VOO:IJR — none)
- **No moving average jargon** (not "short-over-long average setup," not "below both averages")
- Translate chart observations into plain posture statements
- This section must pass the "Jeff's Mother" test — she doesn't know what VOO:IEF means

**How to translate:**
- Instead of "VOO:IEF still tilted toward stocks" → "stocks are still doing better than bonds"
- Instead of "$NAHL above +50" → "the new-highs vs new-lows picture supports staying invested"
- Instead of "VOO:IJR falling into a short-under-long setup" → "smaller companies have started doing better than large ones"
- Instead of "VOO:QQQ rising above its short average" → "tech-heavy stocks have cooled off"
- Instead of "VOO:VEA below both averages" → "international stocks continue to outpace U.S. stocks"

**Structure (follow this order within the paragraph):**

1. **Open with overall posture** — One sentence characterizing the environment (e.g., "This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency")
2. **Link key signals to posture** — Name 2-3 specific chart signals and what each suggests
3. **Name specific areas for action** — Where should attention or position shifts be considered?
4. **Close with grounded summary** — One sentence wrap-up (not generic filler)

**Key requirement:** Each significant chart signal should have a corresponding posture implication. Do not give generic advice — tie guidance to specific observations.

**When a ratio shows a regime change (crossover against the prior trend):**
- This argues for considering a shift in balance between those two areas
- Example: If VOO:IJR shows a bearish crossover after a long period of large cap dominance → consider increasing small cap exposure relative to large caps
- Example: If VOO:VEA shows international now outperforming after US led → consider shifting balance toward international stocks
- Do NOT just say "watch" or "stay open to" — a confirmed crossover is a signal to consider acting

**Signal-to-posture mapping:**

**Overall market posture (risk-on vs risk-off):**
- VIX in calm range (12-20) → supportive environment for equities, no need for defensiveness
- VIX elevated (20-30) → some caution warranted, but not alarm
- VIX high (30+) or spiking → consider defensive positioning
- NAHL above +50 → strong risk-on signal, supports staying fully invested in equities
- NAHL above 0 → risk-on, normal equity exposure appropriate
- NAHL crossing below 0 → caution, consider reducing equity exposure
- NAHL below -50 → significant stress, consider moving toward cash

**Stocks vs Safety (VOO:IEF, VOO:IAU, VOO:BCI):**
- All three bullish (stocks leading bonds, gold, and commodities) → strong support for staying in equities
- All three bearish → consider shifting toward safety assets
- Mixed signals → identify which safety asset is gaining (bonds = flight to safety, gold = uncertainty/inflation hedge, commodities = inflation/supply concerns)
- VOO:IEF bearish crossover → consider shifting some balance from stocks toward bonds
- VOO:IAU bearish crossover → gold gaining as defensive asset, consider adding gold exposure
- VOO:BCI bearish crossover → commodities outperforming, consider real asset exposure
- When the three diverge, the specific safety asset gaining tells you something about the *type* of concern (bonds = rate/recession, gold = uncertainty, commodities = inflation)

**Within equities (segment comparisons):**
- VOO:IJR falling (small caps gaining) → consider increasing small cap allocation relative to large caps
- VOO:IJR rising (large caps leading) → large caps still leading, no argument to shift toward small caps
- VOO:QQQ rising (broad market gaining vs tech) → tech-heavy stocks losing edge, consider broadening toward the average stock
- VOO:QQQ falling (tech leading) → tech-heavy stocks still leading, no argument to shift away
- VOO:VEA falling (international gaining) → consider shifting balance toward international
- VOO:VEA rising (US leading) → US still leading, no argument to shift toward international
- VOO:VWO favoring one side → consider the developed vs emerging balance within international
- Chart unchanged or neutral → it doesn't argue for adjustment (don't mention it)

**Example of good output:**

> "This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The improvement in the new-highs versus new-lows picture argues against an overly defensive stance. At the same time, smaller companies have shown a bullish crossover against large caps, which argues for considering an increase in small cap exposure. International stocks continue to outperform U.S. stocks, suggesting it may make sense to shift some balance toward international holdings. This is a period to stay diversified, avoid overconfidence, and let improving areas prove they can sustain progress."

**Example of bad output (do not write like this):**

> "This feels like a period for maintaining discipline. Staying flexible and avoiding overcommitment to any single narrative makes sense. It may make sense to stay open to areas that are improving, while watching whether recent improvement turns into something more durable."

This is generic advice disconnected from chart evidence. It repeats itself, uses filler phrases, and doesn't name specific areas or actions.

**Language guidelines:**

- Use measured, conditional language such as "consider" or "it may make sense to"
- Refer to specific market segments (small caps, international, etc.) not "the market" as a whole
- When a crossover has occurred, suggest considering a position shift — not just "watching"

**Do not:**

- make buy or sell recommendations (e.g., "buy IJR")
- suggest timing (e.g., "now is the time")
- provide price targets
- imply urgency or certainty
- give generic advice disconnected from the chart signals
- repeat the same point across multiple sentences
- write more than one paragraph

This section should feel practical and grounded, with each suggestion traceable to chart evidence.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

This section provides the supporting evidence behind the Executive Summary.

**Requirements:**

- Include one subsection per chart provided. The number of charts may vary (typically 5–10).
- Analyze every chart that is provided — no more, no less.
- Technical language is permitted here (but not in earlier sections).

**Required chart ordering (same as Paragraph 3):**

1. **$VIX** — Volatility Index
2. **$NAHL** — New Highs vs. New Lows
3. **VOO:IEF** — Stocks vs. Bonds
4. **VOO:IAU** — Stocks vs. Gold
5. **VOO:BCI** — Stocks vs. Commodities
6. **VOO:VEA** — U.S. vs. International Developed
7. **VOO:VWO** — U.S. vs. Emerging Markets
8. **VOO:IJR** — Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap
9. **VOO:QQQ** — Broad Market vs. Tech-Heavy

If a chart is provided that's not on this list, place it in a logical position within this ordering.

**Chart permalinks (include as first line of each chart subsection):**

| Chart | Permalink |
|-------|-----------|
| $VIX | https://schrts.co/xWJYFssp |
| $NAHL | https://schrts.co/UuzcuKia |
| VOO:IEF | https://schrts.co/sXnqcYfh |
| VOO:IAU | https://schrts.co/GyzdpGBx |
| VOO:BCI | https://schrts.co/vDyhfzfd |
| VOO:VEA | https://schrts.co/GtcdSWHh |
| VOO:VWO | https://schrts.co/zKEdhDAw |
| VOO:IJR | https://schrts.co/IDHJXsmz |
| VOO:QQQ | https://schrts.co/DhzZUgpW |

Format: `[Link to chart](permalink)`

**Each chart subsection must follow this structure:**

1. **Link** — First line: `[Link to chart](permalink)` using the permalink from the table above
2. **Observation paragraphs** — State the observable facts:
   - For ratio charts: State whether price is above/below the MAs, whether shorter MA is above/below longer MA, and any recent crossings. **Do NOT state the ratio value itself (e.g., "9.65") — it is meaningless. Only the relationship to the MAs matters.**
   - Example: "Price is above both the 10-week and 40-week MAs. The shorter MA crossed above the longer MA two weeks ago — a bullish signal."
   - For VIX: current level and which range it falls in (12-20, 20-30, etc.)
   - For NAHL: the 13-day EMA value and whether it's above/below key thresholds (0, +50, -50). **Focus on the smoothed EMA only — daily readings are background noise.**
2. **"What this implies:"** — A labeled paragraph interpreting what the observation means
3. **"Signal strength:"** — A rating of Weak, Moderate, or Strong with brief explanation

**Grounding rule:** Your interpretation must match your stated observations. If you state that price is above both MAs with a bullish crossover, your interpretation cannot say the trend is bearish or "unchanged."

**Each chart discussion should cover:**
- what the chart represents
- what it has been showing historically
- what has changed recently (or remained unchanged)
- how it fits with the other charts

**Handling Unchanged Charts:**

Charts that have not changed meaningfully since the prior review should be treated as **background context, not foreground signals**. In the Detailed Chart Analysis, still include them but note that conditions are unchanged. In synthesis sections (Executive Summary, What Should We Do?), do not feature unchanged charts prominently.

**Do not end with a summary paragraph.** The Detailed Chart Analysis should end after the last chart subsection. Synthesis belongs in the Executive Summary, not here.

**Signal Strength Rating:**

Each chart subsection should end with a signal strength rating: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

This rating reflects how clearly and consistently the chart supports a conclusion:

- **Strong** — The pattern is clear, persistent, and hard to dismiss. It anchors the broader interpretation.
- **Moderate** — The signal is visible and meaningful, but needs confirmation from other charts or could reverse.
- **Weak** — The signal is tentative, mixed, or inconsistent. Encouraging or concerning, but not decisive.

This section exists to explain why the summary conclusions were reached, not to introduce new conclusions.

## Tone and Style

Tone, voice, and writing style must follow the document titled tone-and-style-guide.md.

**General expectations:**

- Written for non-investors
- Calm, explanatory, and grounded
- Avoids sensationalism and urgency
- Assumes the reader may be encountering market analysis for the first time

## Final Note

If the charts do not clearly support a strong conclusion, the post should say so plainly.

Clarity and honesty are preferred over confidence.
