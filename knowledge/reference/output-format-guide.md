# Market Look Output Format Guide

## Purpose

This document defines the required structure, section order, and presentation for Jeff's monthly market analysis posts.

The goal is to produce a clear, readable market overview for a general audience, including readers with little or no investing background, while remaining grounded in evidence from charts provided with each analysis.

This guide governs what the reader sees.

Analytical reasoning and decision logic are defined separately in the GPT instructions.

## Required Sections and Order

Every post must contain exactly three sections, in this order:

1. Executive Summary
2. What Should We Do?
3. Detailed Chart Analysis

No additional sections should be added.

Do not include a "What to Watch" section.

Do not use second-level subheaders inside sections.

## Executive Summary (Required, Top of Post)

The Executive Summary must consist of three paragraphs, each with a distinct purpose.

### Paragraph 1 – What Changed Recently

- Describe what has changed over the past month compared with the prior period.
- Focus on new developments, shifts, or threshold crossings.
- This paragraph should read like a monthly update, not a recap of long-term trends.

Do not restate information that has not changed.

### Paragraph 2 – Current Market State in Context

- Describe what kind of market environment this currently is, based on the broader context visible on the charts.
- Situate recent changes within the past year and longer-term patterns.
- Emphasize structure and balance rather than direction or prediction.

This paragraph provides orientation, not outlook.

### Paragraph 3 – Snapshot Across Market Slices

- Summarize key market segments using short, plain-language observations.
- Mention only segments where something has changed or resolved since the prior month.
- Present observations in a consistent order, from more general to more specific:
  - overall calm or turbulence
  - stocks versus safety
  - balance of stocks improving versus falling
  - large U.S. stocks versus smaller U.S. stocks
  - concentrated areas versus the broader market
  - U.S. stocks versus international stocks
  - developed versus emerging international markets

If a segment did not change meaningfully, it should not appear in this paragraph.

This paragraph should point the reader toward the detailed analysis below without duplicating it.

## What Should We Do?

This section translates the evidence from the Executive Summary into portfolio-level thinking, not trading instructions.

**Guidelines:**

- Use measured, conditional language such as "consider" or "it may make sense to."
- Refer to specific market segments rather than "the market" as a whole.
- Focus on balance, emphasis, and defensiveness rather than timing or action.

**Do not:**

- make buy or sell recommendations
- suggest timing
- provide price targets
- imply urgency or certainty

This section should feel practical and grounded, while remaining non-prescriptive.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

This section provides the supporting evidence behind the Executive Summary.

**Requirements:**

- Include one subsection per chart provided. The number of charts may vary (typically 5–10).
- Analyze every chart that is provided — no more, no less.
- Technical language is permitted here (but not in earlier sections).
- Each chart discussion should cover:
  - what the chart represents
  - what it has been showing historically
  - what has changed recently (or remained unchanged)
  - how it fits with the other charts

**Signal Strength Rating:**

Each chart subsection should end with a signal strength rating: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

This rating reflects how clearly and consistently the chart supports a conclusion:

- **Strong** — The pattern is clear, persistent, and hard to dismiss. It anchors the broader interpretation.
- **Moderate** — The signal is visible and meaningful, but needs confirmation from other charts or could reverse.
- **Weak** — The signal is tentative, mixed, or inconsistent. Encouraging or concerning, but not decisive.

This section exists to explain why the summary conclusions were reached, not to introduce new conclusions.

## Tone and Style

Tone, voice, and writing style must follow the document titled tone-and-style-guide.md.

**General expectations:**

- Written for non-investors
- Calm, explanatory, and grounded
- Avoids sensationalism and urgency
- Assumes the reader may be encountering market analysis for the first time

## Final Note

If the charts do not clearly support a strong conclusion, the post should say so plainly.

Clarity and honesty are preferred over confidence.
