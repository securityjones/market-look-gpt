# Executive Summary

Over the past month, market conditions have become noticeably calmer. Large price swings have faded, selling pressure has eased, and several areas that were deteriorating late last year have stabilized. This is a clear change from the November–December period, when stress was rising and weakness was spreading more broadly. The recent improvement does not look dramatic, but it is consistent across multiple charts and suggests that the market has stepped out of an immediately fragile phase.

In the context of the past year, however, this still looks more like a pause and partial repair than a fresh upswing. Many of the longer trends that defined the last twelve months remain in place. Smaller companies are still behind larger ones overall, gains remain uneven across stocks, and leadership continues to come from a narrower set of areas. The market is no longer deteriorating, but it is also not showing the kind of widespread improvement that typically marks a fully rebuilt foundation.

Since last month, several signals have shifted in a more constructive direction. Volatility has continued to settle, reinforcing the calmer price behavior that began late last year. Stocks relative to safer assets have held their ground rather than weakening further. The balance between stocks reaching new highs and new lows has moved decisively out of a caution zone and into a range that, in past periods, has aligned with healthier conditions — removing a key warning that was present in November. Smaller U.S. companies have stopped falling further behind large ones and have shown early signs of catching up. Technology-heavy stocks have pulled back toward longer-term trend lines instead of extending higher. International stocks have continued to outperform U.S. stocks, extending a trend that has been in place for several months, while developed international markets have strengthened relative to emerging markets since October. The sections below walk through each of these charts in detail. Taken together, the charts describe a market that has moved out of a stressed state and into a quieter, more balanced one — but not yet into a broadly strong or fully reinforced phase.

# What Should We Do?

This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The recent calming of conditions and the improvement in the new-highs versus new-lows picture argue against an overly defensive stance, especially compared with late last year. At the same time, the lack of broad follow-through suggests caution about chasing recent strength. It makes sense to remain open to areas that are quietly improving — such as smaller companies showing early signs of catching up and international stocks that have been outperforming — while recognizing that many trends are still uneven. This is a period to stay diversified, avoid overconfidence, and let improving areas prove they can sustain progress before treating the market as fully rebuilt.

# Detailed Chart Analysis

## Volatility Index (VIX)

Over the last 2–3 months, volatility has trended lower and stayed lower.

We've seen fewer sharp spikes and more time spent near the bottom of its recent range. That suggests investors are less reactive day to day, and fear has been receding rather than building.

**What this implies:**
The environment has shifted from anxious to calm. This is supportive, but calm alone doesn't tell us how strong the foundation is.

**Signal strength:** Moderate
The trend is clear, but it needs confirmation from the rest of the market.

## Small vs Large Stocks (IJR:VOO)

This chart has not improved meaningfully over the last few months.

Small stocks continue to lag behind large ones, and while there have been short bounces, they have not changed the overall direction. The ratio is still sitting near its lower range rather than climbing away from it.

**What this implies:**
The market is still leaning on larger companies to hold things together. Smaller companies are not yet participating in a way that signals broad health.

**Signal strength:** Strong
The persistence of this weakness makes it hard to ignore.

## Concentration Proxy (QQQ:RSP)

This ratio has flattened slightly but remains elevated.

In other words, the biggest growth-oriented stocks are still doing more than their equal-weight counterparts, even if the pace has slowed. There's no decisive reversal here—just a pause near the highs.

**What this implies:**
Leadership is still narrow. The market is not breaking, but it's also not being lifted evenly.

**Signal strength:** Moderate
Stabilization helps, but it hasn't turned into broad improvement.

## New Highs vs New Lows (NAHL)

Over the last couple of months, this measure has been choppy but mostly positive.

We're seeing more stocks reaching new highs than new lows, but with wide swings rather than steady progress. Importantly, recent pullbacks have not pushed it deeply negative again.

**What this implies:**
There is some internal repair happening, but it's uneven and tentative rather than decisive.

**Signal strength:** Weak to Moderate
Encouraging, but not consistent enough to anchor the bigger picture.
