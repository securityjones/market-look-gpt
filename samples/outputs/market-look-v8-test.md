## Executive Summary

Over the past month, things stayed pretty calm overall, but the "where" of returns shifted again. Day-to-day turbulence stayed in a normal, quiet range. The big change is that the market continued to reward being spread out: stocks outside the U.S. kept outpacing U.S. stocks, smaller companies started doing better relative to large ones, and the big tech-heavy names stopped widening their advantage. At the same time, gold and commodities kept doing better than U.S. stocks, which is an interesting counterweight to the otherwise steady backdrop.

Stepping back to look at the longer picture, the past year has been a story of a few big U.S. trends gradually losing their grip. Tech-heavy stocks had been pulling ahead for a long stretch, and large U.S. companies had been consistently ahead of smaller ones—but both of those edges have been fading recently. Meanwhile, international stocks (both developed and emerging) have been ahead of the U.S. for months now, and the "real asset" side (gold and commodities) has also had a sustained run of doing better than U.S. stocks. Volatility has mostly stayed contained through all of that, with a few short-lived spikes rather than a persistent rise.

Chart-by-chart, volatility stayed quiet, and the new-highs versus new-lows signal still supports staying invested in stocks (even though it cooled off from earlier highs). Stocks are still doing better than intermediate-term Treasury bonds, but gold and commodities continue to do better than U.S. stocks—so the "stocks vs safety" picture is mixed depending on which "safety" we mean. Outside the U.S., both stocks from other wealthy countries and emerging markets kept outpacing the U.S., and that gap widened again this month. Within U.S. stocks, smaller companies have started to catch up after a long stretch of lagging behind large ones. And the broad market has stopped losing ground to the tech-heavy segment—more like a stabilization than a big reversal. Taken together, this looks like a market that isn't panicking, but is quietly rewarding diversification more than the "just own U.S. mega-cap tech" approach.

## What Should We Do?

This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The calm backdrop and the still-positive "new highs vs new lows" picture argue against getting overly defensive. But the persistent pattern of international stocks outpacing the U.S. suggests it may make sense to keep (or build) a more global balance rather than assuming U.S. stocks will automatically be the main driver. The recent improvement in smaller companies relative to large ones also argues for being open to more balanced exposure inside U.S. stocks instead of leaning entirely on the biggest names. And since gold and commodities are still doing better than U.S. stocks, it's a reminder that diversification across different "safety" buckets can matter—bonds aren't the only offset, and right now they're not the one doing the heavy lifting.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

**$VIX (Volatility Index)**
Volatility is in the normal/calm zone: the VIX is ~15.7 (in the 12–20 range). It's also below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the recent spikes from late last year have not carried through into a sustained rise.
**What this implies:** The market is experiencing relatively quiet day-to-day movement. That doesn't guarantee anything, but it does mean we're not seeing the kind of persistent stress that usually forces a defensive mindset.
**Signal strength:** **Moderate** — the level is clearly calm, but VIX can change quickly.

**VOO:IEF (Stocks vs Intermediate Treasury Bonds)**
Price is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and both averages are rising. The ratio has been trending higher and is near the top of its recent range.
**What this implies:** U.S. stocks continue to do better than intermediate-term Treasury bonds. In plain terms: the "stocks beat bonds" relationship is still intact.
**Signal strength:** **Strong** — clear trend and clean position above both averages.

**VOO:IAU (Stocks vs Gold)**
Price is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and both averages are sloping down. The ratio has continued to fall, meaning gold has continued to do better than U.S. stocks.
**What this implies:** Gold is still winning the head-to-head comparison with U.S. stocks. That often shows up when investors want an alternative "store of value" alongside (or instead of) financial assets.
**Signal strength:** **Strong** — persistent downtrend with price below both averages.

**VOO:BCI (Stocks vs Broad Commodities)**
Price is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, with the shorter average slightly below the longer one. The ratio has broken down from the prior area and moved lower this month.
**What this implies:** Commodities are still doing better than U.S. stocks, and that relationship strengthened over the past month. This is another "real assets are winning" message, similar in spirit to gold.
**Signal strength:** **Strong** — clean position below both averages and continued decline.

**$NAHL (New Highs minus New Lows)**
The 13-day EMA is ~62.6, which is above +50. That's still firmly in the zone that (per this indicator's rules) supports being invested in stocks. The EMA is also well off its earlier peaks, so conditions are a bit less "broadly positive" than they were at the highs.
**What this implies:** The breadth signal confirms we should stay invested in stocks. It's not flashing caution; it's still giving a "green light," just a less enthusiastic one than earlier.
**Signal strength:** **Moderate** — clearly above +50, but not at runaway levels and it has been choppy at times.

**VOO:IJR (Large U.S. Companies vs Smaller U.S. Companies)**
Price is now below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and those averages have started to tilt down. This is a change from much of the prior year when the ratio spent more time above its averages.
**What this implies:** Smaller U.S. companies have started doing better relative to large ones. Because this is a fairly recent turn, it's less about "mission accomplished" and more about "a real change may be starting."
**Signal strength:** **Moderate** — the move is clear, but it's early enough that we want to see it persist.

**VOO:QQQ (Broad U.S. Market vs Tech-Heavy Stocks)**
Price is hovering right around the moving averages, with the 10-week and 40-week roughly on top of each other and fairly flat. After a long, steady decline over the year (favoring tech-heavy stocks), the last stretch looks more like sideways action than continued separation.
**What this implies:** Tech-heavy stocks are no longer pulling further ahead of the broader market. This isn't a loud reversal yet, but it is a meaningful "stop getting worse" message for the rest of the market.
**Signal strength:** **Weak to Moderate** — the stabilization is visible, but it's happening in a tight, choppy range.

**VOO:VEA (U.S. Stocks vs Developed International Stocks)**
Price is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and both averages are sloping down. The ratio pushed lower again this month.
**What this implies:** Stocks from other wealthy countries are continuing to do better than U.S. stocks, and that gap widened again recently. This remains one of the clearest trends in the set of charts you shared.
**Signal strength:** **Strong** — sustained downtrend with no real signs of reversal yet.

**VOO:VWO (U.S. Stocks vs Emerging Markets Stocks)**
Price is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and the averages are sloping down. The ratio remains in a falling pattern, similar to the developed-markets comparison.
**What this implies:** Emerging markets have continued to do better than U.S. stocks. With both developed and emerging beating the U.S. at the same time, the "international over U.S." message is unusually consistent right now.
**Signal strength:** **Strong** — persistent pattern below both averages, reinforced by the developed-markets chart.
