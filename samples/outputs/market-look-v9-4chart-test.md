## Executive Summary

Over the past month, the biggest change is where returns have been showing up. The "health beneath the surface" signal is still in a good place, and stocks are still doing better than bonds — but within stocks, smaller companies have started doing better than the biggest ones, and stocks from other wealthy countries have picked up an edge over U.S. stocks.

Stepping back to look at the longer picture, this still looks more like an "invested" environment than a defensive one. The new-highs vs new-lows signal has spent most of the past year on the constructive side of the line, even if it's had some choppy swings. Stocks versus bonds has also been trending in the same direction for a while. The part that's been less steady over the year is the U.S. vs international story — it's swung around — but the most recent move is clearly away from U.S. outperformance and toward international.

Chart-by-chart: the breadth signal remains above the level that usually supports staying invested, even though it has cooled from higher readings. Stocks compared to bonds are still in an uptrend, with no obvious sign of a breakdown. U.S. stocks compared to developed international have rolled over and pushed lower again — a meaningful shift in who's been doing better lately. And large companies compared to smaller companies have also slipped, suggesting smaller companies have started catching up after a long stretch where they struggled to keep pace. Taken together, this looks like a market that still rewards being invested — but with a stronger case than last month for not letting U.S. large-cap holdings do all the heavy lifting.

## What Should We Do?

This looks like a month for adjustment, not urgency. The new-highs vs new-lows picture is still supportive of staying invested, and stocks are still doing better than bonds — so the evidence doesn't argue for hiding in the safest corners. But the "where" has shifted: smaller companies have started doing better than the biggest ones, and developed international stocks have been doing better than U.S. stocks. That combination argues for taking a fresh look at whether our stock exposure is too U.S.-and-mega-cap heavy, and whether a bit more balance across smaller companies and overseas developed markets would better match what the market has been rewarding lately.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### $NAHL — New Highs vs. New Lows

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/UuzcuKia)

The 13-day EMA is around +62.64, which is above +50. That remains in the "solidly constructive" zone per the NAHL thresholds. Over the last 4–5 bars, the EMA has come down from higher levels, but it hasn't threatened the key lines (0 or -50).

**What this implies:** The breadth signal still supports staying invested in stocks. The cooling tells us the market's internal "push" isn't as strong as it was recently, but it hasn't flipped into a caution signal.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — clearly positive, but not as emphatic as when the EMA is rising or holding well above +50 without fading.

### VOO:IEF — Stocks vs. Bonds

The ratio is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and the 10-week MA is above the 40-week MA. The most recent bars show the ratio holding at the upper end of the recent range, continuing the uptrend rather than breaking down.

**What this implies:** Stocks are still outperforming intermediate Treasury bonds. This is the cleanest "big picture" confirmation in the set we have: the market still prefers stocks over a core safety asset.

**Signal strength:** Strong — trend, MA position, and MA relationship all line up in the same direction.

### VOO:VEA — U.S. vs. International Developed

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GtcdSWHh)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and the 10-week MA is below the 40-week MA. Over the past month, the ratio has pushed lower, moving farther away from the moving averages rather than snapping back.

**What this implies:** Developed international stocks are outperforming U.S. stocks, and this month's move looks like a real step in that direction rather than a minor wobble. If we're thinking about geographic balance, the evidence currently favors "don't be only U.S."

**Signal strength:** Strong — decisive positioning below both averages with recent follow-through.

### VOO:IJR — Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/IDHJXsmz)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, and the 10-week MA is below the 40-week MA. The last few bars include a sharp drop that pulled the ratio down through the averages, suggesting a more recent turn than a long, smooth trend.

**What this implies:** Small-cap stocks have started outperforming large-cap stocks. Given how abrupt the recent move is, this reads more like an "early turn" than a fully settled new normal — but it's a meaningful change from the prior pattern where large caps mostly kept the upper hand.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the signal is clear on the chart right now, but it still looks fresh enough that we'd want to see it persist.
