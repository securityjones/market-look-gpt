## Executive Summary

Over the past month, conditions stayed pretty calm, and stocks kept doing better than bonds. The more noticeable change was inside stocks: smaller companies started doing better than the big ones after a long stretch of lagging, while the tech-heavy part of the market gave back a bit of its recent edge. Outside the U.S., stocks from other wealthy countries continued to do better than U.S. stocks, and within international markets, the wealthy-country group has been doing better than emerging markets lately.

In the context of the past year, the bigger picture still looks like a market that has generally rewarded owning stocks over safer assets, with only brief bursts of turbulence. The "where" of returns has also been fairly consistent: tech-heavy stocks have generally been doing better than the average stock, and stocks from other wealthy countries have been doing better than U.S. stocks for much of the past year. The newer development is that smaller companies—after trailing for a long time—are starting to show the first signs of a turn.

Chart-by-chart: $VIX is still sitting in the calm zone and remains below its longer-term averages. VOO:IEF is above both moving averages and continues to push higher, keeping the "stocks over bonds" message intact. $NAHL's 13-day EMA is at +62.64 (still above +50), though it's lower than it was a month ago. IJR:VOO has moved back above both averages and the 10-week has nudged above the 40-week—a fresh crossover after a long decline. QQQ:RSP has pulled back under its 10-week average but stays above the 40-week, with the shorter average still above the longer one. VOO:VEA is below both averages and the 10-week remains below the 40-week, with a sharp downdraft over the last month. VEA:VWO is above both averages and the 10-week is above the 40-week, pointing to developed international beating emerging markets right now. Taken together, the backdrop still looks fairly constructive, but the "who's carrying things" inside stocks is shifting.

## What Should We Do?

This is an environment that calls for adjustment and balance, not urgency. Day-to-day turbulence has stayed muted and stocks are still doing better than bonds, which argues against getting overly defensive. At the same time, smaller companies have started doing better than the biggest companies after a long stretch of lagging, and U.S. stocks continue to trail stocks from other wealthy countries—both of which suggests it may make sense to consider nudging some balance away from "only the biggest U.S. names." And since the tech-heavy part of the market has cooled a bit, it's a reminder not to rely on a single corner of the market to do all the work. The practical takeaway is to stay diversified, let the improving areas prove they can keep it up, and avoid overcommitting to last year's winners.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### $VIX — Volatility Index

The VIX is around 15–16, which sits in the "normal/calm" range (12–20). It's also below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the last month has mostly looked like quiet, low-to-mid teens trading with only small pops higher.

**What this implies:** Day-to-day turbulence remains contained. That's generally a friendlier backdrop for stocks—but because the level is fairly calm, we also want to stay aware that calm can change quickly if something breaks the mood.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the level is clearly calm, but the VIX can change quickly and doesn't "stay predictable."

### VOO:IEF — Stocks vs. Bonds

Price is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is above the 40-week average, and over the past month the ratio has pushed to fresh highs rather than stalling.

**What this implies:** Stocks continue to do better than intermediate-term Treasury bonds, and that preference has not faded over the last month. This lines up with an environment where investors are still willing to own risk assets.

**Signal strength:** Strong — the trend is clean (above both averages) and the recent month reinforced it rather than questioning it.

### $NAHL — New Highs vs. New Lows

The 13-day EMA is +62.64, which is above the +50 threshold. Over the past month, that smoothed line has come down from higher readings but stayed comfortably above +50.

**What this implies:** More stocks are still reaching new highs than new lows, and the balance remains positive. The "cooling" versus last month matters, but it has not flipped the message.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — staying above +50 is meaningful, but the recent drift lower asks for a little humility.

### IJR:VOO — Small-Cap vs. Large-Cap

After a long decline, price has pushed back above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average has also edged just above the 40-week average—a fresh crossover. The move over the last month is visibly different from the prior trend: instead of grinding lower, the ratio has popped upward and held.

**What this implies:** Smaller companies have started doing better than large companies, and the shift is notable because it comes after a long stretch where the opposite was true. The key question now is whether the ratio can stay on the "above both averages" side rather than slipping back into the old pattern.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the crossover is fresh and meaningful, but it's still early enough that we want to see it persist.

### QQQ:RSP — Tech-Heavy vs. Broad Market

Price has dipped below the 10-week moving average over the last month, but it remains above the 40-week moving average. The 10-week average is still above the 40-week average, and both have generally been rising over the broader window.

**What this implies:** Tech-heavy stocks have given back some ground recently versus the average stock, but the longer trend still shows tech-heavy stocks doing better overall. This is more "cooling off" than a clear trend break—at least so far.

**Signal strength:** Weak — the short-term pullback is clear, but it hasn't yet changed the longer trend.

### VOO:VEA — U.S. vs. International Developed

Price is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the last month saw a sharp downdraft that moved the ratio further away from those averages rather than recovering toward them.

**What this implies:** Stocks from other wealthy countries continue to do better than U.S. stocks, and the last month reinforced that pattern rather than challenging it.

**Signal strength:** Strong — clean "below both averages" behavior plus a decisive month in the same direction.

### VEA:VWO — Developed vs. Emerging International

Price is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is above the 40-week average, and the ratio has been rising over the last month.

**What this implies:** Within international stocks, the developed-market group has been doing better than emerging markets recently, and the moving-average setup says that's not just a one-week blip.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the trend is clear right now, but this ratio has historically been choppier than some of the others.
