## Executive Summary

Over the past month, the big picture stayed pretty steady: day-to-day swings remained fairly quiet, and the "under the surface" read on the market still looks healthy. The main change is that the winners inside the stock market are shifting a bit. The U.S. hasn't been the strongest place to be, and smaller companies have been doing a little better than the biggest ones.

Stepping back to the longer picture, we're still in a market where stocks have generally done better than intermediate-term Treasury bonds. But it hasn't been a clean "all-clear" environment. Over the last year, gold and broad commodities have continued to keep pace with—or beat—stocks, which usually shows up when investors still want some insurance in the mix. And on the geography question, stocks from other wealthy countries (and even emerging markets) have been doing better than U.S. stocks for a while now.

Chart-by-chart, volatility is still in the normal, calm range, though it has inched higher lately. The new-highs vs new-lows signal remains comfortably in a zone that supports staying invested in stocks. Stocks are still doing better than bonds, but they're not beating gold or commodities. Outside the U.S., both developed international and emerging markets continue to outpace U.S. stocks. Within the U.S., smaller companies have been outperforming large ones recently. And the "broad market vs tech-heavy stocks" comparison has been more of a stalemate lately—less of a one-way story than it was earlier.

## What Should We Do?

This looks like an environment for staying invested, but staying balanced. The calm backdrop and the healthy new-highs vs new-lows signal argue against getting overly defensive. At the same time, the fact that gold and commodities are still beating stocks suggests we don't want to build a portfolio that only works if stocks are the only thing that matters. International stocks continuing to outpace the U.S. makes a case for keeping meaningful exposure outside the U.S., and the recent improvement in smaller companies argues for not ignoring that part of the market either. Put differently: we can participate, but we don't need to "bet the farm" on one narrow corner of the stock market.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### $VIX — Volatility Index

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/xWJYFssp)

VIX is around the mid-teens (about 15–16), which sits in the normal/calm 12–20 range. Over the most recent stretch it has ticked up a bit from a lower level, but it has not pushed into the "elevated stress" zone above 20.

**What this implies:** Conditions still look fairly calm, with a small rise in uncertainty that's worth noting but not yet a "risk event" type of move.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the level is clearly calm, but the recent uptick keeps it from being a clean "all-clear."

### $NAHL — New Highs vs. New Lows

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/UuzcuKia)

The 13-day EMA is about +62.6, which is above the +50 threshold. The smoothed line is not at its peak from earlier in the cycle, but it remains solidly positive.

**What this implies:** This breadth signal supports staying invested in stocks. It's not flashing caution.

**Signal strength:** Strong — above +50 is a clear, historically constructive zone.

---

### VOO:IEF — Stocks vs. Bonds

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/sXnqcYfh)

The ratio is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is above the 40-week average, and the ratio has been trending upward into the right edge.

**What this implies:** Stocks are still outperforming intermediate-term Treasury bonds, which is usually consistent with a market that isn't in "flight to safety" mode.

**Signal strength:** Strong — the trend and moving-average structure are aligned and persistent.

---

### VOO:IAU — Stocks vs. Gold

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GyzdpGBx)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the ratio has been in a declining trend.

**What this implies:** Gold has been outperforming stocks. That often shows up when investors still want a hedge in the mix, even if stocks are doing fine versus bonds.

**Signal strength:** Strong — the downtrend is clear and sustained.

---

### VOO:BCI — Stocks vs. Commodities

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/vDyhfzfd)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is slightly below the 40-week average, and the ratio has been drifting downward.

**What this implies:** Broad commodities have been outperforming stocks. Like gold, this usually argues for respecting real-asset exposure rather than assuming stocks are the only game in town.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the message is consistent, but it has been more choppy than the gold comparison.

---

### VOO:VEA — U.S. vs. International Developed

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GtcdSWHh)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the ratio has stayed depressed since the big break earlier in the cycle.

**What this implies:** Developed international stocks have been outperforming U.S. stocks. This continues to argue for meaningful diversification outside the U.S.

**Signal strength:** Strong — a persistent pattern with a clear moving-average setup.

---

### VOO:VWO — U.S. vs. Emerging Markets

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/zKEdhDAw)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the ratio has been mostly sideways-to-down recently.

**What this implies:** Emerging markets have been outperforming U.S. stocks on a relative basis. Along with the developed-international chart, this reinforces that "outside the U.S." remains the stronger side of the ledger.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the message is consistent (below both averages), but the recent action is more sideways than strongly directional.

---

### VOO:IJR — Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/IDHJXsmz)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the ratio has softened into the right edge after being higher earlier.

**What this implies:** Smaller U.S. companies have been outperforming large ones recently. It's a noticeable change from periods where the biggest companies did most of the work.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — clear relative improvement for small caps, but it's still early enough that we'd like to see it persist.

---

### VOO:QQQ — Broad Market vs. Tech-Heavy

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/DhzZUgpW)

The ratio is very close to both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, with the two averages nearly on top of each other. The last stretch looks more sideways than trending.

**What this implies:** The broad market and tech-heavy stocks have been closer to "running together" lately, rather than one consistently pulling away. This is more of a balance signal than a directional one.

**Signal strength:** Weak — the ratio is essentially in a tight range, so it's not giving a strong push in either direction.
