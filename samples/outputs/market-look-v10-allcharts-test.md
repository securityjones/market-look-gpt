## Executive Summary

Over the past month, the big picture didn't turn dramatic — prices mostly stayed in a calmer mode — but the "where" of returns kept shifting. Day-to-day turbulence remained contained, the underlying "health check" across stocks stayed favorable, and stocks continued to do better than Treasury bonds. The notable change is that the U.S. has not been the center of gravity lately: stocks from other wealthy countries — and even emerging markets — have continued to pull ahead.

In the context of the past year, this still looks like a market that has made room for more than one story at a time. Stocks have generally had the upper hand over bonds, but gold and commodities have been the consistent competitors in the background. And inside stocks, the trend that has mattered most has been the sustained edge for international stocks versus the U.S., with a more recent hint that smaller U.S. companies are no longer falling further behind the biggest ones.

Chart-by-chart: volatility is still in a normal, calmer zone; the new-highs-versus-new-lows signal remains firmly in the "stay invested" range; stocks continue to beat bonds, but gold and commodities are still beating stocks; international stocks (both developed and emerging) continue to outpace the U.S.; smaller companies look like they're starting to keep up after a long stretch of lagging; and the tech-heavy trade no longer looks like it has the same clear advantage over the broad market that it had earlier in the cycle. Taken together, this reads less like a single straight-line bet and more like an environment where diversification is getting paid again.

## What Should We Do?

This environment calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The new-highs-versus-new-lows picture still argues against an overly defensive stance, and stocks are still doing better than bonds — both of which support staying engaged. At the same time, the fact that gold and commodities keep doing better than stocks suggests we shouldn't assume "stocks solve everything" right now, and it may make sense to keep some balance through real-asset exposure rather than running a one-asset playbook. Inside stocks, the cleanest message is that international markets are still leading the U.S., and smaller U.S. companies are showing early signs of catching up — so if we're making any tweaks, it's reasonable to consider whether we're too U.S.-heavy and too concentrated in the biggest names, while letting the improving areas prove they can keep it up.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### $VIX — Volatility Index

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/xWJYFssp)

VIX is sitting around the mid-teens (about 15–16), which is in the normal/calm zone. It's below its longer-term average (and slightly below the shorter one), and while it has bounced a bit off the recent lows, it's not behaving like an active stress event.

**What this implies:** Day-to-day price swings remain muted, which is generally a supportive backdrop for staying invested. The small uptick is worth noticing, but it's still "calm with occasional bumps," not "nervous market."

**Signal strength:** Moderate — supportive, but not a decisive driver on its own.

### $NAHL — New Highs vs. New Lows

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/UuzcuKia)

The 13-day EMA is about +62.6 and remains above +50, which is the "solidly constructive" zone in this framework. Recent weeks show the smoothed line holding in that range rather than slipping back toward zero.

**What this implies:** The breadth signal continues to support staying invested in stocks. This is the kind of reading that typically shows up when market conditions are behaving in a healthier way beneath the surface.

**Signal strength:** Strong — it's a clear, rule-based "stay invested" signal.

---

### VOO:IEF — Stocks vs. Bonds

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/sXnqcYfh)

The ratio is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week is also above the 40-week, and both averages are generally sloping upward. The last month looks like a continuation rather than a reversal.

**What this implies:** Stocks are still outperforming intermediate Treasury bonds, which usually lines up with a less-defensive environment.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — clear trend, but it's only one slice of the "stocks vs safety" picture this month.

---

### VOO:IAU — Stocks vs. Gold

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GyzdpGBx)

The ratio is below both moving averages, and the 10-week is below the 40-week. The averages are sloping down, and the most recent bars remain pinned under them.

**What this implies:** Gold is outperforming stocks. That's a meaningful counterpoint to the "stocks over bonds" message — it suggests investors are still willing to own a "backup plan" asset even while stocks hold up versus bonds.

**Signal strength:** Strong — persistent and hard to dismiss.

---

### VOO:BCI — Stocks vs. Commodities

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/vDyhfzfd)

The ratio is below both moving averages, with the 10-week sitting below the 40-week. The recent bars continue to sit under that ceiling rather than breaking back above it.

**What this implies:** Broad commodities are outperforming stocks. Along with gold, this reinforces that "real assets" have been doing better than U.S. stocks for a while — a reminder that stocks aren't the only game in town right now.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — consistent, though not as clean as the gold signal.

---

### VOO:VEA — U.S. vs. International Developed

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GtcdSWHh)

The ratio is below both moving averages. The 10-week is below the 40-week, and the recent bars pushed lower rather than reclaiming those averages.

**What this implies:** Developed international stocks continue to outperform U.S. stocks, and the recent month did not show meaningful "catch-up" by the U.S. side.

**Signal strength:** Strong — a clear, ongoing trend.

---

### VOO:VWO — U.S. vs. Emerging Markets

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/zKEdhDAw)

The ratio is below both moving averages, with the 10-week slightly below the 40-week. The recent bars dipped again, staying under the averages rather than breaking through them.

**What this implies:** Emerging-market stocks are outperforming U.S. stocks on a relative basis. Combined with the developed-markets chart, the international lead is not limited to one corner — it's fairly broad.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — clear direction, but less "clean" than the developed-markets signal.

---

### VOO:IJR — Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/IDHJXsmz)

The ratio is below both moving averages, and the 10-week is below the 40-week. Recent bars remain under those averages, which suggests the shift has persisted for more than just a week or two.

**What this implies:** Smaller U.S. companies are outperforming larger ones on a relative basis. After a long period where the biggest companies had an easier time pulling ahead, this is at least an early sign that the "average" company is starting to participate more.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — constructive, but still something we want to see persist.

---

### VOO:QQQ — Broad Market vs. Tech-Heavy

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/DhzZUgpW)

The ratio is around its moving averages: it's slightly above the 10-week and roughly in the neighborhood of the 40-week, with the 10-week still near (and a touch under) the 40-week. Net-net, this reads more like a flattening/neutral phase than a strong, directional trend.

**What this implies:** The tech-heavy group is no longer clearly pulling away from the broad market the way it did in earlier stretches. That doesn't mean tech is "bad" — it just means the advantage isn't as obvious right now, and the broad market has been able to keep up.

**Signal strength:** Weak — informative, but not decisive.
