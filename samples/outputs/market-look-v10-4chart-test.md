## Executive Summary

Over the past month, the big change is where stocks have been doing better. Stocks outside the U.S. pulled further ahead of U.S. stocks, and smaller U.S. companies started doing a bit better than the very large ones. Meanwhile, the overall "stay invested" backdrop didn't really crack.

Stepping back to look at the longer picture, the "stocks versus bonds" comparison has been trending in favor of stocks for quite a while, and that's still the case today. The health-under-the-surface indicator (new highs versus new lows) has also worked its way back into a historically constructive zone after last year's rough patches. What's shifting more recently is the internal mix within stocks: the U.S. has been losing some ground to other wealthy-country stock markets, and the gap between big and small U.S. companies has started to narrow.

Putting the charts together: the new-highs vs new-lows signal still supports staying invested in stocks. Stocks are still doing better than bonds. Within stocks, developed international markets continue to outpace the U.S., and smaller U.S. companies have been doing better than large ones in recent weeks. Taken together, this looks less like "risk is rising" and more like "returns are spreading out to different places."

## What Should We Do?

This is an environment that calls for adjustment rather than urgency. The new-highs vs new-lows signal remains in a range that has typically aligned with staying invested, and stocks are still doing better than bonds—so the evidence doesn't argue for getting more defensive. The more actionable shift is inside stocks: stocks from other wealthy countries have been pulling ahead of U.S. stocks, and smaller U.S. companies have started to outperform the biggest ones, which argues for considering a bit more balance across regions and company sizes rather than leaning on the same U.S. large-company winners.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### $NAHL — New Highs vs. New Lows

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/UuzcuKia)

The 13-day EMA (the signal line) is around +62.6, which places it above +50. Over the last several weeks it has eased a bit from higher readings, but it has stayed in the "solidly positive" zone rather than slipping back toward zero.

**What this implies:** This continues to read as a "stay invested" backdrop for stocks. The slight cooling matters less than the fact that the signal remains comfortably above the key threshold.

**Signal strength:** Strong — the signal is clearly in the above-+50 zone.

### VOO:IEF — Stocks vs. Bonds

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/sXnqcYfh)

The ratio is above both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is above the 40-week average, and both have been sloping upward over the past year. The last few weeks look more like a pause than a reversal.

**What this implies:** Stocks are still doing better than intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds. That doesn't guarantee smooth sailing, but it does mean the "hide in bonds" case isn't being reinforced by this chart right now.

**Signal strength:** Strong — trend and moving-average structure are still aligned.

### VOO:VEA — U.S. vs. International Developed

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/GtcdSWHh)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average, and the last several bars show a renewed push downward rather than stabilization.

**What this implies:** Developed international stocks (the large, established markets outside the U.S.) have been outperforming U.S. stocks, and that outperformance has picked up again recently.

**Signal strength:** Strong — the ratio is cleanly below both averages and moving lower.

### VOO:IJR — Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap

[Link to chart](https://schrts.co/IDHJXsmz)

The ratio is below both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week average is below the 40-week average. The decline into the right edge suggests this shift is relatively recent and still being confirmed.

**What this implies:** Small-cap U.S. stocks have been outperforming large-cap U.S. stocks in recent weeks. After a long stretch where large companies generally had the upper hand, this chart is saying the gap is narrowing—and small caps are the side currently doing better.

**Signal strength:** Moderate — the signal is clear, but it looks newer and more "in motion" than the longer-running trends above.
